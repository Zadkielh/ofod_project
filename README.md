# Optical Flow and Object Detection in Video Games
Project for Computer Vision

The premise of the project is using Optical Flow to detect moving objects in a video game or capture of a video game, and then using object detection to classify
the detected object. This opens exciting avenues for uses like creating AI or Bots that can make decisions on similar input like a human would. 

# NOTES
The program utilizes OpenCVs CUDA support. This requires hardware compatible with CUDA.
More information can be found here: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html
Without CUDA, performance and capabilites will be severly limited.

For testing without CUDA, refer to section Setup (CUDA-less)
